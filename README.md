"FlashQuiz"

This program is an online interactive quiz where users can test themselves on different categories of trivia questions.
We used the Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/) to generate 10 random questions for each category. There are 5
categories to choose from: Art, General Knowledge, History, Mathematics, and Science/Nature. This program was built using
a mixture of HTML/CSS for the front-end, and Javascript for the back-end. This the first hackathon for all of us and we
didn't accomplish as much as we would hope. Despite that, we still had an enjoyable and memorable experience!
